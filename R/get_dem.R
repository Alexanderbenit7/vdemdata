#' Get episodes of democratization (autocratic adaption, democratic deepening)
#'
#' Helps to identify episodes of democratization (liberalization, democratic deepening) in the most recent vdem data set.
#' \emph{Democratization} is an umbrella term for any movement towards demcracy - be it in autocracies or democracies.
#' \emph{Autocratic adaptation} is defined as a subtype of democratiztion and specifically focuses on any movement towards democracy
#' which starts in autocracies. \emph{Democratic deepening} is also a subtype of democratization and
#' concerns all those which are already democratic and further improve their democratic traits (cf. Wilson et al., 2020).
#'
#' @param data The data based on which the episodes are identified.
#' By default the most recent vdem data set.
#'
#' @param start_incl A threshold for detecting the onset of "potential" democratization episodes.
#' By default a positive change in the EDI (Vdem's Electoral Democracy Index) of at least +0.01 from year(t-1) to year(t).
#'
#' @param cum_incl A threshold to identify a "manifest" episode of democratization as a cumulative positive change of the EDI (Vdem's Electoral Democracy Index)
#' between the start and end of a sequence. By default a cumulative change of +0.1 on the EDI.
#'
#' @param year_turn A threshold to identify a sudden "turn" during a year of an ongoing episode of democratization (=failed democratization).
#' By default a yearly change of -0.02 on the EDI (Vdem's Electoral Democracy Index).
#'
#' @param cum_turn A threshold to identify a gradual "turn" during an ongoing episode of democratization (=failed democratization).
#' By default a cumulative change of -0.1 on the EDI (Vdem's Electoral Democcracy Index) between the start and end of a sequence.
#'
#' @param tolerance A threshold to specify the number of "stasis" observations (\emph{i.e.}, observations neither increasing
#' or decreasing significantly) permitted before stopping a sequence. By default 10 years.
#'
#' @param output The default output is a data frame. Alternatively, output = "summary" prints the overall observed numbers of each episode types to the console,
#' output = "table" compiles a short table showing each country with start and end year of each episode and episode ID.
#'
#' @return A data frame specifying episodes of democratization in the most recent Vdem data set: democratic deepening for those episodes starting in democracy ("dem_ep_dem") and
#' autocratic adaptation for those episodes starting in autocracy ("dem_ep_aut"), further distinguishing successful opening episodes ("success"), and three types of failure,
#' (1) preempted ("fail_preem"), (2) reverted ("fail_rev"), and (3) stabilized autocracy ("fail_stab").
